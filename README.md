Bajaj Stock Price Analysis (2003–2020)

This project examines over 17 years of historical stock price data for Bajaj Auto, one of India’s major automotive manufacturers. The analysis covers long-term trend behavior, anomaly detection using statistical techniques, time-series forecasting through ARIMA, and machine-learning clustering to segment trading patterns.

The goal is to build a complete, end-to-end analytics workflow that mirrors how financial analysts, quantitative researchers, and market data teams approach real-world stock behavior.

🔍 Project Overview

This analysis focuses on:

Understanding long-term stock trends

Detecting unusual or outlier trading activity

Forecasting closing prices using ARIMA models

Grouping similar trading behaviors using K-Means clustering

Applying a consistent, structured data-cleaning process

Generating clear visualizations for insight-driven storytelling

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Key steps performed:

Standardized column names for consistency

Parsed and sorted the date column

Converted all numerical fields into correct datatypes

Removed invalid/corrupted rows

Interpolated missing values to maintain a continuous time series

Verified dataset integrity before modeling

This ensures the dataset is reliable for forecasting and machine-learning tasks.

⚠️ Anomaly Detection (Z-Score Method)

Anomalies were identified using a Z-Score threshold of ±3, applied on:

Closing price

Turnover

Traded quantity

Number of trades

This method helps highlight trading days with unusually high or low activity compared to historical patterns.

🔮 ARIMA Time-Series Forecasting
Process Summary

Resampled data to a consistent daily frequency

Used an 80/20 train–test split

Automatically searched for the best ARIMA (p, d, q) using AIC scoring

Compared model predictions to actual values

Generated a 30-day price forecast with confidence intervals

Evaluated the model using MAE and RMSE
